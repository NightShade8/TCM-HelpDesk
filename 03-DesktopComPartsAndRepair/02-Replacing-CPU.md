# Step-by-Step Process for Replacing a CPU

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 1. Prepare the Workspace  

- Work on a **flat, clean, and static-free surface**.  
- Ensure the workspace is **well-lit**.  
- Avoid carpets and wear **ESD-safe clothing** if possible.  
- **ESD precautions:**  
  - Wear an **anti-static wrist strap** and connect it to a grounded surface (like the case).  
  - Use an **ESD mat** for the components.

## üîß 2. Gather Tools and Materials  

### **Tools:**  
- Phillips-head screwdriver (for case screws).  
- Thermal paste (if not included with the new CPU or cooler).  
- ESD-safe tweezers (optional).  

### **Materials:**  
- New CPU.  
- Compatible CPU cooler (may come with the CPU or be purchased separately).  
- Lint-free cloth or coffee filters (for cleaning).  
- Isopropyl alcohol (90% or higher) to clean old thermal paste.

## üñ•Ô∏è 3. Turn Off and Disconnect the System  

- **Power down the computer**.  
- Unplug the power cable and all peripherals (monitor, keyboard, etc.).  
- Press and hold the power button for 5‚Äì10 seconds to discharge remaining power.

## üè∑Ô∏è 4. Open the Computer Case  

- Remove the side panel of the computer case using the screwdriver.  
- Place the screws in a safe location.

## ‚ö° 5. Locate and Remove the Old CPU  

### **1. Remove the CPU Cooler:**  
- Disconnect the cooler's fan cable from the motherboard.  
- Loosen screws or clips holding the cooler in place (varies by cooler type).  
- Gently twist the cooler back and forth to break the thermal paste bond, then lift it off.  
  - *Tip:* Do NOT force the cooler off, as it can damage the CPU socket.  
- Place the cooler on a safe surface.  

### **2. Clean the Old Thermal Paste:**  
- Use a lint-free cloth or coffee filter with isopropyl alcohol to clean old thermal paste from the CPU and cooler contact plate.  

### **3. Remove the Old CPU:**  
- Locate the CPU socket and lift the **retention arm** or unlock the socket mechanism (varies by socket type).  
- Carefully lift the CPU out of the socket by its edges.  
- Place the old CPU in an anti-static bag or protective box.

## üì• 6. Install the New CPU  

### **1. Check CPU Compatibility:**  
- Ensure the new CPU is compatible with your motherboard (check socket type and BIOS version if needed).  

### **2. Insert the CPU:**  
- Align the **gold triangle** on the corner of the CPU with the **triangle marker** on the motherboard's socket.  
- Gently place the CPU into the socket without forcing it.  
- Lower the retention arm or locking mechanism to secure the CPU in place.  

---

## üß¥ 7. Apply Thermal Paste  

- If the CPU cooler does not have pre-applied thermal paste:  
  - Squeeze a **pea-sized dot** of thermal paste onto the center of the CPU.  
  - Do NOT spread it manually‚Äîthe pressure from the cooler will spread it evenly.  

---

## üîÑ 8. Reinstall the CPU Cooler  

### **1. Reattach the Cooler:**  
- Place the CPU cooler onto the CPU, aligning it with the mounting holes.  
- Tighten screws or secure clips evenly in a diagonal pattern to ensure even pressure.  

### **2. Connect the Cooler Fan:**  
- Plug the cooler's fan cable into the appropriate **CPU_FAN** header on the motherboard.  

---

## üñºÔ∏è 9. Close the Case  

- Reattach the side panel of the case and secure it with screws.  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 10. Power On and Test  

### **1. Reconnect cables and peripherals:**  
- Plug in the power cable, monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc.  

### **2. Power on the system:**  
- Ensure the system boots and enters the BIOS.  
- Check if the CPU is correctly recognized in the BIOS.  

### **3. Monitor temperatures:**  
- Use a hardware monitoring tool (like HWMonitor or Core Temp) to check CPU temperatures.
