# Introduction to IP Addresses  

An overview of IP addresses, their types, subnetting, and essential networking protocols.

## 📄 Definition  

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to devices in a network to enable identification and communication.  

---

## 🔢 Format  

- **IPv4:** 32-bit, written as `192.168.1.1`.  
- **IPv6:** 128-bit, written as `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.

## 🌍 Types of IP Addresses  

1. **Public IP:**  
   - Globally unique and used to connect to the Internet.  
   - Example: `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS).  

2. **Private IP:**  
   - Used within private networks (e.g., homes, offices).  
   - **Ranges:**  
     - `10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255`  
     - `172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255`  
     - `192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255`  

3. **Static IP:**  
   - Fixed and manually configured.  
   - Common for servers or networked printers.  

4. **Dynamic IP:**  
   - Automatically assigned by a DHCP server.  
   - Common for most devices.

## 🧮 Subnetting  

Divides a network into smaller, manageable segments (subnets).  
- **Example:** `192.168.1.0/24` represents a subnet with 256 possible addresses.

## 🔑 Key Protocols in Networking  

1. **TCP/IP:**  
   - Core protocol suite for Internet communication.  

2. **HTTP/HTTPS:**  
   - Protocols for web browsing.  

3. **DNS:**  
   - Resolves domain names to IP addresses.  

4. **DHCP:**  
   - Assigns dynamic IP addresses.

## 📚 Conclusion  

Networks enable seamless communication and resource sharing, with IP addresses playing a vital role in identifying and connecting devices. Understanding basic networking concepts and IP types is crucial for managing modern systems.
