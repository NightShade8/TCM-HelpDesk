# Notes on VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)

## 📄 What is a VPN?

A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** is a technology that creates a **secure and encrypted** connection over a public network (e.g., the Internet). It allows users to access private networks remotely while maintaining privacy and security.

## 🔄 How VPNs Work

1. **Encryption**: VPN encrypts data before sending it over the Internet, preventing unauthorized access.
2. **Tunneling**: VPNs create a secure "tunnel" between the user and the destination network.
3. **IP Masking**: The VPN server assigns a different IP address, hiding the user’s real location.

## 🌐 Types of VPNs

- **Remote Access VPN** – Allows individuals to securely connect to a private network from anywhere.
- **Site-to-Site VPN** – Connects entire networks (e.g., branch offices) over the Internet securely.
- **SSL VPN** – Uses a web browser for secure remote access without needing special software.

## 🔒 Common VPN Protocols

| **Protocol**           | **Description**                                             |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)** | Fast but weak encryption.                         |
| **L2TP/IPSec (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)**  | More secure, supports strong encryption.          |
| **OpenVPN**             | Highly secure, open-source, widely used.                   |
| **WireGuard**           | Modern, fast, and lightweight VPN protocol.                |
| **IKEv2/IPSec**         | Good for mobile devices, stable and secure.                |

## ✅ Benefits of Using a VPN

- **Security** – Protects data from hackers and surveillance.
- **Privacy** – Hides IP address, preventing tracking.
- **Bypassing Geo-Restrictions** – Access region-locked content.
- **Safe Public Wi-Fi Usage** – Encrypts traffic on unsecured networks.
- **Remote Access** – Employees can securely access corporate networks.

## ❌ VPN Limitations

- **Slower Speeds** – Encryption may reduce connection speed.
- **Blocked by Some Services** – Some websites detect and block VPNs.
- **Not a Complete Anonymity Tool** – VPNs do not make users 100% anonymous.
