## ðŸ“š Sections Overview

### 1. Binary & Hexadecimal Concepts
Learn how digital systems represent numbers using binary and hexadecimal formats. This section covers conversions between number systems and introduces measurement units like nibbles and bytes.

---

### 2. Encoding & Visual Data
Explore how digital content such as images and videos is encoded using binary data. Understand the importance of color values, pixel positions, and how frames are used to create video sequences.

---

### 3. Processor Architecture
Dive into the components of a CPU, including the Control Unit, ALU, Registers, Cache, and Clock, to understand how they work together to execute instructions.

---

### 4. Instruction Lifecycle
Understand the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle, a step-by-step process by which a CPU retrieves, interprets, and executes instructions to perform tasks.

---

### 5. Everyday Analogy
Simplify complex processor functions through a relatable analogy, comparing a CPU to a chef preparing a recipe in a kitchen.

---

### 6. Instruction Example
See a practical application of the instruction lifecycle with a step-by-step breakdown of how a CPU executes a basic arithmetic operation.
