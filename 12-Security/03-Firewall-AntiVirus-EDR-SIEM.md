# 🔥 Firewalls, Antivirus, EDR & SIEM

## 🔹 **1. Firewalls**
A **firewall** monitors and controls incoming/outgoing network traffic, acting as a security barrier.

### **Types of Firewalls:**
- **Packet Filtering Firewall** – Allows or blocks packets based on rules.
- **Stateful Inspection Firewall** – Tracks active connections.
- **Proxy Firewall** – Intermediary that filters requests before forwarding them.
- **Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)** – Integrates IPS and deep packet inspection.

✅ **Importance:**
- Prevents unauthorized access.
- Filters malicious traffic.
- Enhances network security.

## 🛡 **2. Antivirus**
Antivirus detects, prevents, and removes malware, such as viruses, trojans, ransomware, and spyware.

### **Functions of Antivirus:**
- **Signature-Based Detection** – Identifies known malware.
- **Heuristic Analysis** – Detects suspicious behavior.
- **Real-Time Scanning** – Continuously monitors system activity.

### **Examples:** Windows Defender, Norton, Bitdefender, Kaspersky.

✅ **Importance:**
- Protects against malware.
- Ensures safe browsing and file execution.

## 🖥️ **3. Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)**
EDR provides **real-time monitoring, detection, and response** for threats on endpoints.

### **Key Features:**
- **Threat Detection** – Uses AI and behavioral analysis.
- **Incident Response** – Enables fast mitigation.
- **Threat Hunting** – Identifies hidden attacks.

### **Examples:** CrowdStrike Falcon, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, SentinelOne.

✅ **Importance:**
- Protects against advanced threats.
- Provides deep visibility into endpoint activity.

## 📊 **4. Security Information & Event Management (SIEM)**
SIEM collects and analyzes security logs to **detect and respond to threats**.

### **Key Functions:**
- **Log Management** – Centralizes security logs.
- **Event Correlation** – Identifies attack patterns.
- **Threat Detection** – Uses AI for security monitoring.

### **Examples:** Splunk, IBM QRadar, Microsoft Sentinel.

✅ **Importance:**
- Improves security visibility.
- Helps with compliance.
- Speeds up threat detection and response.
