# 🎭 Social Engineering

## 📄 What is Social Engineering?

**Social Engineering** is a psychological manipulation tactic used by cybercriminals to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. It exploits human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities.

## 🔄 Common Social Engineering Techniques

### **1. Phishing**
- Fraudulent emails, messages, or websites designed to trick users.
- **Examples**:
  - Fake **bank alerts** asking for login details.
  - **PayPal scam emails** leading to phishing sites.

### **2. Pretexting**
- Creating a fake scenario to manipulate victims into providing information.
- **Example**: An attacker impersonates **IT support** to obtain employee login credentials.

### **3. Baiting**
- Luring victims with **enticing offers**, leading to security compromise.
- **Example**: Free **software downloads** containing malware.

### **4. Tailgating (Piggybacking)**
- Gaining **physical access** to a restricted area by following an authorized person.
- **Example**: An attacker **pretending to be a delivery person** to enter a secure facility.

### **5. Quid Pro Quo**
- Offering **something in return** for sensitive information.
- **Example**: Fake IT help desk requesting **login details** to "fix an issue."

### **6. Impersonation**
- Pretending to be a **trusted individual** (employee, vendor, law enforcement).
- **Example**: An attacker **calls HR**, requesting employee personal data.

## ✅ How to Prevent Social Engineering Attacks

🔹 **Security Awareness Training** – Educate employees on recognizing threats.  
🔹 **Verify Requests** – Always confirm legitimacy before sharing sensitive data.  
🔹 **Implement Strict Access Controls** – Restrict unauthorized physical entry.  
🔹 **Monitor Logs & Activity** – Detect suspicious interactions early.
