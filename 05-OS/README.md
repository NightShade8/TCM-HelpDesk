# Operating System (OS) Overview
An OS manages hardware and provides services to applications, acting as an intermediary between users, apps, and hardware.

## Key Functions
- **Abstraction:** Simplifies hardware complexities for users.
- **Arbitration:** Ensures efficient resource allocation among processes.

## OS Architecture
- **Userland (User Space):** Where apps run, accessing the OS through APIs.
- **Kernel:** Core part of the OS, managing hardware and system processes.

## API vs System Calls
- **API:** Interface for apps to interact with the OS.
- **System Calls:** Requests from userland to kernel for services like file operations and memory management.

## Applications, OS, and Hardware Interaction
The OS abstracts hardware, ensuring applications donâ€™t directly interact with hardware.

# File System Basics
File systems organize data on storage devices, with various types like NTFS, ext4, and APFS.

## File System Hierarchy & Navigation
Files are organized in a tree structure, with commands like `ls` (Linux/macOS) and `dir` (Windows) for navigation.
