# Key Functions of an Operating System  

---

## üñ•Ô∏è 1. Abstraction  

- The operating system simplifies complex hardware details by providing a user-friendly interface for applications and users.  
- Instead of requiring programs to handle individual hardware instructions, the OS provides standardized APIs and abstractions for hardware resources like:  
  - **Memory**  
  - **Storage**  
  - **Input/Output**

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Arbitration  

- The OS manages access to hardware resources among multiple users and processes to avoid conflicts and ensure fairness.  
- Examples of resource management include:  
  - **CPU Scheduling**  
  - **Memory Allocation**  
  - **Disk I/O Management**
