# Relationship Between Applications, OS, and Hardware  

This section explains how operating systems mediate interactions between applications and hardware, ensuring abstraction, control, and efficient resource management.

## üñ•Ô∏è Applications (Userland)  

- Applications like web browsers, games, and text editors operate in **userland**.  
- They interact with the OS through **APIs** rather than directly accessing hardware.  
- Applications rely on the OS for hardware access, staying unaware of the specifics of underlying components.  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è OS (Userland + Kernel)  

- The operating system serves as an interface between applications and hardware, managing resources and processes.  
- It ensures **fair arbitration** of hardware resources among multiple processes or users.  
- Provides **abstractions** to simplify hardware complexity for applications.  

---

## üíæ Hardware  

- Includes components like the **CPU**, **memory**, **storage**, **I/O devices**, and **network interfaces**.  
- Executes instructions sent by the OS but remains inaccessible to applications in userland.

## üîç Example: Opening a File  

### **Process Flow:**  
1. **Application in Userland:**  
   - A text editor requests to open a file by calling an API function, e.g., `fopen("example.txt", "r")`.  

2. **API Call:**  
   - The API converts the request into a **system call**, such as `open()`.  

3. **System Call:**  
   - The system call is passed to the **kernel**, transitioning the process from userland to kernel space.  

4. **Kernel:**  
   - The kernel interacts with the file system and hardware (e.g., disk controller) to locate and retrieve the file.  

5. **Return to Userland:**  
   - The kernel sends the file descriptor or an error code back to the application via the API.  

6. **Application Uses the File:**  
   - Using the file descriptor, the application performs actions like reading or writing, potentially triggering additional system calls (e.g., `read()` or `write()`).
