## üõ†Ô∏è Hybrid Use  

In many organizational settings, a combination of **local users** and **domain users** is used to address different needs:  

- **Local Admin Accounts:**  
  IT administrators often rely on local accounts for **emergency troubleshooting** or maintenance tasks, especially when network services are unavailable.  

- **Domain Accounts for Employees:**  
  Regular employees use domain accounts for **seamless access** to shared resources, applications, and network environments.
